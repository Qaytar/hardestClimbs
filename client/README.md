# Title
Hardest Climbs

## Description

This application is a React-based web application that provides a minimalistic and up to date summary of the hardest (in the world) climbs/sends in bouldering and sport climbing.

A climb or send consists fundamentally on a route climbed on a date with a given climbing grade done by a climber.

### Key Features:

- **Modular design** Through react components, the app is very modular and could be extended or refactored easily
- **Dynamic content** As the database gets updated with new ascents, no modifications are required in the app. All content, metrics and summaries are dynamic.
- **Dynamic Grading System:** Users can toggle between European and American grading systems according to their preference.
- **Dynamic data visualitzation:** Users can toggle between two different views of the same data. Sends chronologicaly ordered or sends grouped by climber (ranked by harder climbs).
- **Responsive Design:** The app provides a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes, thanks to its responsive design.

This application has been built using React for the frontend, and Node.js and Express for the backend.

Data is stored in Atlas Mongodb and is updated manually by the admin 

The app incorporates search engine optimization (SEO) strategies for better discoverability; the FAQ.js component, which adds metadata with Google's FAQ Schema and then also renders it on the page.

We hope that our application serves as a valuable tool for the climbing community, fostering their passion for this adventurous sport.
